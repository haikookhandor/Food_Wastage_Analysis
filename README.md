# Food_Wastage_Analysis
This contains the analysis made of mess menu food wastages for IIT Gandhinagar for years 2019-20.
The aim of this project is to study the mess food wastage of IIT Gandhinagar, analyze the food
wasting habits and suggest remedies to reduce food wastage. The mess halls in IIT
Gandhinagar serve hundreds of students, faculty, and staff members each day. Despite efforts
like display of food wastage through a white board, save food banners to minimize food
wastage, a significant amount of food is still being wasted. This project aims to study the mess
food wastage in detail and identify the factors contributing to it. By analyzing the amount of food
wasted, we can gain insights into the patterns and habits of food wastage. Additionally, we
conducted a Google form survey with the students to understand their preferences of food
based on which we have conducted our analysis. Based on our analysis, we suggest remedies
to reduce food wastage.Our ultimate goal is to help the mess hall in IIT Gandhinagar become
more sustainable and reduce its environmental impact while also saving costs.

Some of the suggestions we give through the analysis of the data are
1. The menu can include items which are wasted the most and the least together to reduce
wastage. For example: Mix Veg with higher wastage could be served with Besan Gatta
which has a low wastage.
2. Items which have the highest average wastages should not be served together. For ex:
In Lunch, we should not serve Mix. Veg with Veg. Kadhai.
3. New vegetables could be introduced in dinner especially as the mean of data wastage
with frequency is high in both aspects perhaps due to repetition. Thus new vegetables
could be introduced to mitigate this wastage.
4. Our findings suggest that food wastage primarily occurs when individuals put more food
on their plates than they can consume. To address this issue, we recommend creating
awareness and implementing rules to prevent students from wasting food.
